"""Customers views package.

Split mirrors the layout used by :mod:`sales.views`:

* :mod:`customers.views.crud` — list / create / edit / detail / delete.
* :mod:`customers.views.actions` — POST-only buttons on the detail
  page (record payment, manual adjustment, write off, delete payment,
  delete ledger row, add/remove phone).
* :mod:`customers.views.api` — JSON endpoints called from the cashier's
  sales-entry screen.
* :mod:`customers.views._shared` — small helpers (currently form-error
  flashing).

This ``__init__`` re-exports every public view, so ``customers.urls``
(and any future ``from customers import views`` callers) keep working
with no changes.
