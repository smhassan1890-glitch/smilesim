"""Sales views package.

The sales surface is large enough that a single ``views.py`` got hard to
navigate, so it is split into focused submodules:

* :mod:`sales.views.employee` — entry form and JSON helpers used by
  the cashier's screen.
* :mod:`sales.views.management` — list/queue pages plus the per-sale
  lifecycle actions (approve, reject, mark paid, cancel, edit, delete).
* :mod:`sales.views.payment_methods` — CRUD for the PaymentMethod
  taxonomy.
* :mod:`sales.views.bulk` — multi-row actions (currently bulk
  mark-as-paid).
* :mod:`sales.views._shared` — small HTMX response helpers.

This ``__init__`` re-exports every public view so callers (urls.py,
external imports, tests) keep working without changes.
