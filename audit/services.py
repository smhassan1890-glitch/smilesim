"""Helpers for writing audit events from the service layer.

Service code calls :func:`record` whenever it commits a meaningful
mutation. The helper is deliberately tolerant — bad data, a missing
actor, or even an exception serialising the diff must never bubble out
and abort the user's action; auditing is observation, not enforcement.
